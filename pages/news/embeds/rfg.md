## Transcript

**Tweet from flaki (@slsoftworks):**

> Ever wished for a conference where any & all sessions show up *instantly* in a Replay box after they aired, to be re(?)watched anytime, even if you just grabbed your ticket halfway through the event?
>
> I did.
>
> So I built it. 🙈
>
> Probably my favorite @RustFest Global feature. 💖

*Quoted tweet from Florian Gilcher (@Argorak):*

> Listening into the last artist sets while the talks start to the left. @slsoftworks wasaabi is really fun :)

*[Attached screenshot](https://s3.flak.is/waasabi/media/embeds/rfg-img1.jpg) by Florian shows the Live Stream page of RustFest Global 2020. The screen is split in the middle, the left half showing a large countdown until the start of the next talk. On the right a replay of one of the previous sessions showing ("Artist performance: Dahlia Fae (music) & Jay Weeks (visuals)")*

**Tweet thread from flaki (@slsoftworks) continued:**

> Oh well, this might as well be the close second. 💜
>
> At RustFest Global we explicitly asked our sponsors to think "outside the box" for perks—and not in booths & spamming our attendees: very few took up on the offer.
>
> And then came @EmbarkStudios... :)

*[Attached video](https://s3.flak.is/waasabi/media/embeds/fade.mp4) is a short recording of the browser screen during the live stream of RustFest Global 2020. On the left is the live video feed with the emcee is introducing the upcoming speaker from Embark Studios. On the right there is conference information for the currently logged in user. After a couple seconds the green background of the live stream page around the video area fades into dark purple, and the RustFest Party Ferris illustration in the corner is replaced by an Embark Studios logo floating in.*

*Quoted tweet from Alexander Varwijk (@Kingdutch):*

> The custom player used by @RustFest allows changing the surrounding page to match the branding of one of our sponsors, @EmbarkStudios, during a talk by one of their developers 😍 Awesome work @slsoftworks

*[Attached screenshot](https://s3.flak.is/waasabi/media/embeds/rfg-img2.jpg) by Alexander shows the Live Stream page during the talk, on the left the it's the speaker introduction slide of Anastasia Opara, on the right another live video feed showing the live sketchnotes of the talk*

**Tweet thread from flaki (@slsoftworks) continued:**

> THIS is why we do this, y'all 😭💕

*Attached screenshot of a message from the conference chat reads: "Just watched a replay of Linalab & !ME since I missed it live. And wow. It was a rapture of senses, I felt there was a hidden Option‹Feeling› inside me, and it just got unwrapped. Thank you for the beautiful performance @lina @notme"*

> (they are talking about [link to quoted tweet], which is *every bit as wonderful* as advertised 💖)

*Quoted tweet from RustFest (@RustFest):*

> RustFest Global 2020 is almost over, but make sure you don’t miss the last performance by @linalab && !ME, an exploration about the analogue and manual side of both music and visuals. Tune in on https://watch.rustfest.global and celebrate the ending with us!

*[Attached photo](https://s3.flak.is/waasabi/media/embeds/rfg-img3.jpg) shows two people standing on-stage in almost complete darkness, lit by only their instruments and the projection of swirling colors behind them*

**Tweet thread from flaki (@slsoftworks) continued:**

> One of the issues with (intentionally) no tracking or data extraction is: how do you know if people are using your features?
>
> Well, one way is: break the feature and see who complains 🙈

*Quoted tweet from RustFest (@RustFest):*

> Quick note: we realized replays on the website are currently broken.
>
> We gave @slsoftworks some Matcha Latte & a croissant, so he’s now fixing that up as well.
> Sorry for that.

*Reply from Ted Mielczarek (@TedMielczarek) that same day:*

> Awesome work, that sounds amazing! Every time someone tweets about a conference talk the replies are full of "when will the recording be available?"
