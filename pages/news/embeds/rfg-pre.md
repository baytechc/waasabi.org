*[Attached screenshot](https://s3.flak.is/waasabi/media/embeds/rfg-pre-img1.jpg) shows an early version of the RustFest Global 2020 Live Experience. The top half of the screen has the shared "MultiPlayer Snake" experience open, the page explains how the game could be played together with other attendees. The bottom half of the screen is split between the conference chat on the left, and the live presentation video feed on the right where Stefan is presenting about the development of the game experience*
