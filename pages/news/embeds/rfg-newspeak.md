> Just confirmed: there isn't a speaker at @rustfest up until now that I have seen before. Many of them, I didn't even hear of before. Which, given that I was 100%ing @rustlang conferences for a while is a great!

**Reply by Vi (@gl4cierBlue):**

> Very happy to have had the opportunity to speak at [@RustFest](https://twitter.com/RustFest) as a newbie speaker - this morning was a great experience :)

**Reply by AÃ¯ Maiga (@ai_maiga):**

> Yes me too. It was my first technical talk ever! Great experience, especially reply to questions and learn from people!
