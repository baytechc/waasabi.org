# Waasabi Captions

This is an effort to implement fully independent, local machine transcript augmentation and automatic transcript generation using open source technologies and open data/models. Initial work on this project has been sponsored by the Grant for the Web.

This project is currently in the *feasability study* stage, although [current results are really promising](https://community.webmonetization.org/waasabi/automated-captions-for-everyone-with-waasabi-3522).
