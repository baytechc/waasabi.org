# Waasabi P2P

This is an ongoing effort to furnish Waasabi with a decentralized, peer-to-peer video distribution backend that would allow Waasabi events to operate with small hardware/investment constraints and with costs that could scale better with the rising interest in the content.

Various P2P approaches to enable the above are currently being investigated through the [NLnet NGI0 grant program](https://nlnet.nl/project/Waasabi/).
