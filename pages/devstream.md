# Waasabi DevStream

> **Update (August 26, 2023)**  
> The DevStream is currently on on hiatus.

The DevStream is a way for us to *eat our own dogfood*, as we stream Waasabi development... on Waasabi! Keep an eye [on the chat](https://matrix.to/#/#waasabi:baytech.community), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bayareatechclub) and [Waasabi Live](https://live.waasabi.org) for newly scheduled live episodes in the coming weeks.
