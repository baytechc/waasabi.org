# Setup

The [Waasabi Configurator](https://waasabi.org/install) is a commandline graphical user interface for creating new custom Waasabi instances.

Launch the configurator with the `npx waasabi` command and follow the on-screen instructions to generate a new Waasabi instance configuration.

The resulting configuration file can be tested locally in a container, deployed on a server or VPS or even deployed to a newly-provisioned cloud server (a feature currently in the works).
