# What is “Waasabi”?

*Welcome to the Waasabi project's documentation!*

Waasabi is a customizable open-source framework for building online event experiences. The name loosely derives from the Estonian words *"koos"* and *"kaasabi"*, meaning "together" and "support":  
*Waasabi aims to provide you with tools to build novel, unique online events and experiences to bring people together!*

Waasabi is [open source](https://github.com/baytechc/?q=waasabi) and is managed by the Estonian non-profit [Bay Area Tech Club](https://baytech.community/).
